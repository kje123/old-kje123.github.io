	</h1>
	<p>
		3DBoot is a small project that I decided to make to test my knowledge on HTML, as I'm just beginning to learn.
	</p>
	<p> 
		 I was thinking "What could I make with basic code that would be helpful to others?" I decided on this. Essentially, this is a<br>webpage that redirects to exploits. (rxTools, browserhax, ect) I'm going to try to keep this as updated as possible. With this, you<br>should only need one bookmark on your 3DS that will boot anything you need! No more crowded bookmark page that you<br>have to search for to start rxTools!

		If you have any recommendations or questions, feel free to go <a href="http://google.com">here</a> and I'll be sure to answer, as I'm on gbaTEMP almost every day.<br>Note that this is not the optimal way to boot anything, and should not be used as a reliable exploit.
