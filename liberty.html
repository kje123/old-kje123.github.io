	<h1>
		To hell with the king!!!
	</h1>

	<p>
		Unto what is a violation of our rights as Britishmen, we are being handicapped our freedom by the King we call a disciple of god! Such blasphemy has duly not gone unnoticed by the colonies, whether it be by the scientific brains of Benjamin Franklin or the lowest negro on this side of Georgia. The king and his <i> dispicable </i> parliament have found it within their wicked hearts to deem us "irrelevant" in any choice of our taxation! We, as the people of the British-American colonial society, deserve to be treated with the respect we carry as Englishmen, despite the fact we were never of mother blood. We have given them warnings and protest, what with the Boston Tea Party and the creation of an American militia alliance, and we have been pushed to the limits of our patience. It is time to rebel, to seperate us from the tyrannical King we call our ruler! For the freedom of us granted by our benevolent God almighty! For the freedom of our children, and their children's children! For the freedom of us as a united people! The <i> oh-so mighty </i> king will tremble in his throne when he hears the name of the people of the United Nations of America!

		So what can you do?
	</h1>

	<p>
		Being people stricken by this horrid misrepresentation of our political significance, you can fight back against this tyranny and make sure you leave your footprint right into the king's arse! Join the uprising against England, and truly represent your freedom! Men, take part in becoming a revered minuteman, a soldier that will defend his rights on a minute's notice. Forget the taxes that the British claim we "owe" them, and save your shillings for local goods that supports America only! Never forget that even though you are but one, you are still a significant part of the revolution as a whole!

		What are you waiting for, join the Revolution today!

		Seperated, we are forgotten; United,  we are unstoppable
